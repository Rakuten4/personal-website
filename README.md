# Techvilla — Frontend Demo

This is a small static frontend for a fictional store "Techvilla" (phones & gadgets). It contains a responsive product grid, search and category filter, product modal and a simple cart counter.

How to preview
- Open `Index.html` in your browser (double-click or use VS Code Live Server).

Files
- `Index.html` — main page wired to styles and scripts
- `styles.css` — basic responsive styling
- `scripts.js` — product data and UI interactions

Notes
- This is static demo data. Hooking it up to a backend or adding persistent cart storage is a recommended next step.
