          <h3>3. Proposals, Acceptance & Changes</h3>
          <p>A proposal is valid for the period stated in the proposal. Acceptance occurs upon a signed proposal or when work commences. Any change requests affecting scope, schedule, or price will be documented and approved via a change order.</p>

          <h3>4. Fees, Invoicing & Payment</h3>
          <ul>

          <h3>5. Client Responsibilities</h3>

          <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Adetop retains ownership of pre-existing tools, libraries, and methodologies. Upon full payment, Adetop grants the client a non-exclusive license to use deliverables for their intended business purpose. Any third-party components are subject to their own licenses.</p>

          <h3>7. Confidentiality</h3>
          <p>Both parties agree to protect confidential information and not disclose it except as required by law. Confidential information does not include publicly available information or information independently developed without use of the other party's confidential data.</p>

          <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Adetop's total liability for any claim arising under these Terms shall not exceed the total fees paid by the client to Adetop under the relevant SOW in the 12 months preceding the claim. Neither party will be liable for lost profits, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

          <h3>10. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>The client agrees to indemnify and hold Adetop harmless from claims arising from client's breach, use of deliverables in violation of laws, or client-provided content that infringes third-party rights.</p>

          <h3>11. Termination</h3>
          <p>Either party may terminate for material breach if the breach is not cured within 30 days of written notice. Upon termination, client must pay for work performed up to the termination date and return confidential materials. Provisions intended to survive termination (IP, confidentiality, limitation of liability) will remain in effect.</p>

          <h3>12. Data & Security</h3>
